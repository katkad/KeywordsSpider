    debug_enabled => 1,

  );

DESCRIPTION

Spider is web spider, which spiders links, and matches their content against keywords.
Keyword trigger ALERT to output_file.
Allowed keywords do not trigger ALERT.

Websites are defined by 'want_spider' parameter in the links hash.
The are spidered to 'web_depth' (default 3), and links in their content are added to links hash.
Other links are just checked for keywords, no spidering.
